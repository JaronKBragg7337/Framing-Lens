# Perspective / Framing Exercise (v3)-(default settings) 

(Default Setting prompts- can be changed based on perspective and environment)

This is a quick framing exercise. It is not a test and there is no pass/fail.

## What this is for

I'm collecting how different people naturally respond to ambiguous prompts so I can:
- understand different viewpoints without trying to change anyone,
- reduce friction by matching people to tasks where they're most effective,
- build stronger teams by pairing complementary response styles.

## ## What this does not assume (not restrictions)

- does not assume a “who is right” frame
- does not assume hiring/firing as the use case
- does not assume ranking anyone’s worth
- does not assume a personality label or diagnosis
- does not assume a values/morals test

## Creator note 

This was created with my own intentions, but it’s meant for you to have your own too.
Changes are allowed and encouraged when they improve fit for your environment and use case. - this is just what the creator I Jaron Kyler Bragg used to make this and is a working system as is)

## How to answer (important)

For each prompt, reply in this exact format:

1. **Choice:** A / B / C / D / E / (F if available)
   - You can pick more than one only if you truly mean it.
2. **Reason:** 1–2 sentences
3. **First step:** If this was real life, what would you do first? (1 sentence)
4. **Risk / blind spot:** What might your answer miss? (1 sentence)
5. **Optional:** If you could rewrite the line in your own words, what would it say? (1 sentence)

**Important:** The option order is intentionally different for each prompt. Please read each one.

## What I do with results (simple)- (Default settings)

I look for patterns like:
- protect vs build (risk-first vs progress-first)
- concrete vs interpretive (literal vs metaphor)
- constraint-first vs possibility-first
- single-answer vs context-dependent
- self/credit vs system/function

Then I use those patterns to match people to roles/tasks where they'll perform best and to pair people who naturally balance each other.

**Multi-use note:** Results are descriptive, not prescriptive—people can apply them however they want (teamwork, learning, communication, creative work, or personal reflection); this exercise doesn't require or assume any single "correct" use-case.
