# Roadmap

## MVP (core) -( Default settings) 

- Session-first flow
- Prompt set v3 included
- Modular outputs (core + optional modules)
- Policy options for sharing/identity/retention (environment-chosen)

## Track A — Cohorts (one possible organizer)

- Invite code / cohort collection
- Aggregate views (if selected by environment policy)

## Track B — Workspaces (one possible organizer)

- Workspaces + roles (owner/admin/member) if an environment wants it
- Team dashboards (module-based)

## Track C — Prompt remixing

- Import/export prompt sets (JSON)
- User-defined prompt sets
- Versioning as a tool, not a lock

## Track D — Publishing / collaboration

- Public mode (indexed)
- Collaborative sessions (multi-respondent)
- Commenting/annotation (optional)

## Extension tracks (examples)

The roadmap shows initial development tracks. Other tracks can be added based on environment needs:

- **Temporal analysis** (tracking pattern evolution)
- **Cross-context comparison** (same person, different environments)
- **Integration APIs** (connect to other tools/platforms)
- **Generative applications** (use patterns as inputs for other systems)
- **Localization** (translate prompts, adapt cultural framing)

Tracks are not exhaustive. The system is designed to support extensions we haven't imagined yet.
